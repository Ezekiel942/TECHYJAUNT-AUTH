## What is this project?
This is a car rental app! You can see cars, rent them, and pay for your rental online. You need to sign up and log in to use it.

## What can you do here?
- **See all cars:** You can look at all the cars in the app.
- **Add a car:** If you are an admin, you can add new cars.
- **Edit or delete cars:** Admins can change car details or remove cars.
- **Search for cars:** You can find cars by name or other details.
- **Rent a car:** Pick a car, pay for it using Flutterwave, and it will be marked as rented.
- **Authentication:** You need to sign up and log in. You get a special token to use protected features.
- **Forgot password:** If you forget your password, you can ask for a reset. The app will send you an email with a code (OTP).

## How does payment work?
When you want to rent a car, you pay using Flutterwave. After you pay, the app checks if your payment was successful and marks the car as rented for you.

## How do you use the app?
1. **Sign up** with your email and password.
2. **Log in** to get your token.
3. **See cars** and pick one you like.
4. **Rent the car** and pay online.
5. **Check your email** for password reset if you forget it.

## What is still missing?
- Profile pictures for users (coming soon!)
- Email and OTP verification (coming soon!)
